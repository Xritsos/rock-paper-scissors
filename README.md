# Rock - Paper - Scissors Game

In this game a CNN model is created, trained and deployed in order to compete with a random agent on the Rock - Paper - Scissors Game.
The model can be found in the `model` folder. Also, some pictures have been added in the `pictures` folder taken by a smartphone to demonstrate the model's accuracy. 
As can be seen from the plot below, the CNN model outperforms the random agent, as expected.
